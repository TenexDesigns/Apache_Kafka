To use the Bitnami/Kafka Docker container in the above context, you will need to start the container and expose the necessary ports.

To start the container, you can use the following command:

```
docker run -d -p 9092:9092 --name kafka bitnami/kafka:latest
```

This will start the container and expose port 9092, which is the port that Kafka uses to communicate.

Once the container is running, you can start using it in your Spring Boot application. To do this, you will need to configure your Spring Boot application to use the Kafka broker that is running in the container.

To do this, you can set the following properties in your Spring Boot application.properties file:

```
spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers=localhost:9092
```

You can then use the Spring for Apache Kafka project to develop your Kafka application.

Here is an example of a Spring Boot Kafka producer application that uses the Bitnami/Kafka Docker container:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class KafkaProducerApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(KafkaProducerApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Autowired
    private KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;

    @PostConstruct
    public void sendMessage() {
        kafkaTemplate.send("my-topic", "Hello, Kafka!");
    }
}
```

To run this application, you would first need to start the Bitnami/Kafka Docker container. Once the container is running, you can start the Spring Boot application.

To do this, you can use the following command:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

This will start the Spring Boot application and send a message to the `my-topic` topic.

You can then consume the message from the topic using a Kafka consumer application.

Here is an example of a Spring Boot Kafka consumer application that uses the Bitnami/Kafka Docker container:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class KafkaConsumerApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(KafkaConsumerApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Autowired
    private ConsumerFactory<String, String> consumerFactory;

    @PostConstruct
    public void consumeMessage() {
        Consumer<String, String> consumer = consumerFactory.createConsumer();
        consumer.subscribe(Collections.singletonList("my-topic"));

        while (true) {
            ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(100);
            for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) {
                System.out.println("Received message: " + record.value());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

To run this application, you would also need to start the Bitnami/Kafka Docker container. Once the container is running, you can start the Spring Boot application.

To do this, you can use the following command:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

This will start the Spring Boot application and consume any messages that are on the `my-topic` topic.

I hope this helps!
