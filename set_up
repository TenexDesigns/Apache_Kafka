The error message you're encountering suggests that the Kafka Docker image you are using hasn't been properly configured. Kafka typically relies on Apache ZooKeeper for distributed coordination, but the error message indicates that it's not configured for either Raft (a consensus protocol) or ZooKeeper mode. Additionally, it warns about the use of a PLAINTEXT listener, which is not recommended for production environments due to security concerns.

To resolve this issue, you should properly configure the Kafka Docker container. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Choose a Distributed Coordination Mode**:
   - Decide whether you want to use Apache ZooKeeper or Raft for distributed coordination. Typically, ZooKeeper is used, but Raft is an alternative. For ZooKeeper, you can configure Kafka to use it as a ZooKeeper ensemble for coordination.

2. **Modify the Kafka Configuration**:
   - To configure Kafka's mode (ZooKeeper or Raft) and other properties, you should create a custom `server.properties` file for Kafka. You can create a custom `server.properties` file on your host machine, specifying the desired properties.

   - For example, to configure Kafka to use ZooKeeper, you can create a `server.properties` file with ZooKeeper settings:

     ```properties
     listeners=PLAINTEXT://:9092
     log.dirs=/bitnami/kafka/data
     zookeeper.connect=zookeeper-server:2181
     ...
     ```

     Ensure that you have the appropriate properties, especially the `zookeeper.connect` property, which points to your ZooKeeper ensemble.

3. **Run the Kafka Container with Your Custom Configuration**:
   - Start the Kafka Docker container while mounting your custom configuration file into the container. You can do this using the `-v` (volume) option when running the container:

     ```bash
     docker run -d --name kafka -p 9092:9092 -v /path/to/your/server.properties:/bitnami/kafka/config/server.properties bitnami/kafka:latest
     ```

     Replace `/path/to/your/server.properties` with the actual path to your custom configuration file.

4. **Test Your Kafka Setup**:
   - Once the Kafka container is up and running with your custom configuration, you should be able to connect to it from your Spring Boot application without encountering the previous error.

Please ensure that you've properly configured Kafka for your intended mode (ZooKeeper or Raft) and that you've created a custom `server.properties` file that contains all the necessary properties. Make sure to adjust the configuration settings according to your specific needs and network setup.

I apologize for the previous response, which assumed that you were using a Kafka cluster that includes ZooKeeper.

If you are not using ZooKeeper, then you need to configure Kafka to work in Raft mode. To do this, set the `KAFKA_CFG_MODE` environment variable to `raft`.

You should also consider using a more secure listener protocol than PLAINTEXT. For example, you can use TLS or SASL.

Here is an example of how to start the Kafka Docker image with the necessary environment variables set:


docker run -d -p 9092:9092 --name kafka -e KAFKA_CFG_MODE=raft -e KAFKA_CFG_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP="PLAINTEXT:SSL" bitnami/kafka:latest


This will start a Kafka cluster in Raft mode with a secure listener protocol.

Once the Kafka cluster is running, you can start using it in your Spring Boot application. To do this, you will need to configure your Spring Boot application to use the Kafka broker that is running in the container.

To do this, you can set the following properties in your Spring Boot application.properties file:

```
spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers=localhost:9092
spring.kafka.ssl.enabled=true
```

You can then use the Spring for Apache Kafka project to develop your Kafka application.

I hope this helps!

To enable ZooKeeper mode in Kafka, you need to set the `KAFKA_CFG_MODE` environment variable to `zookeeper`. You also need to start a ZooKeeper server and make it accessible to the Kafka server.

Here is an example of how to start the Kafka Docker image with ZooKeeper mode enabled:


docker run -d -p 9092:9092 --name kafka -e KAFKA_CFG_MODE=zookeeper -e KAFKA_CFG_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=zookeeper:2181 bitnami/kafka:latest


This will start a Kafka cluster in ZooKeeper mode and connect it to the ZooKeeper server running on port 2181.

You can start a ZooKeeper server using the following Docker command:

```
docker run -d -p 2181:2181 --name zookeeper bitnami/zookeeper:latest
```

This will start a ZooKeeper server running on port 2181.

Once the Kafka server and ZooKeeper server are running, you can start using Kafka in your Spring Boot application. To do this, you will need to configure your Spring Boot application to use the Kafka broker that is running in the container.

To do this, you can set the following properties in your Spring Boot application.properties file:

```
spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers=localhost:9092
```

You can then use the Spring for Apache Kafka project to develop your Kafka application.

I hope this helps!
